# Chapter 0: Randomness

## Random Walks

**Random walk** - a path defined as a series of random steps.

Random walks are useful for modeling phenomena likes molecules moving in a gas, an animal foraging for food, or a gambler at a casino.

The random walk is important to consider because it is central to the two questions constantly asked throughout this course.

- _"How do you define the rules that govern the behavior of your objects?"_
- _"How do you implement these rules in code?"_

## random()

The `random()` function from p5.js produces a **uniform distribution**, where the selection of numbers is relatively even over time. The random numbers generated by the function are **pseudorandom**, meaning they are generated from an algorithm meant to simulate random.

A uniform randomness isn't always what you want when trying to simulate the complexity of natural systems and organisms. For this reason, we actually leverage `random()` to return **nonuniform distributions**, where some numbers are favored over others. This approach is helpful when building out more complex natural systems, such as the Darwinian idea of "survival of the fittest".

### Some Basic Probability Principles

I am adding some definitions here since I didn't take Statistics or Probability in college and it's been over 15 years since I studied it.

**Single-Event Probability** - The likelihood that a given event will occur.
**Outcomes** - All possible results of a random process.  
**Event** - The specific outcome or combination of outcomes being considered.
